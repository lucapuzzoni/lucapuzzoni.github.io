# Solution

In this misc challenge we just have a JSON written in a file.

This JSON is made up as follow:

```json
{
	"targets": [...],
	"monitors": [...],
	"extensions": [...],
	"meta": {...}
}
```

I confess that the challenge includes a bit of guessing. But the `name` of the challenge, the `yellow cat` in the description and the `monitors` field in the JSON makes me mind about [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted) and in fact the JSON file is a Scratch project.

Basically load this file in the Scratch web page and run the sprite.
